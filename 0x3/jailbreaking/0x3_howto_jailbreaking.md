## Yalu
Download the latest [Yalu jailbreak IPA](http://www.iclarified.com/58417/where-to-download-yalu-jailbreak-from) and [Cydia Impactor](https://cydia.saurik.com/api/latest/2) and save them to a folder on your computer.

## Impactor 
* Connect your iPhone to your computer via USB and Launch Impactor. Please make sure to select Trust if prompted.
 
* Drag and drop the mach_portal+yalu IPA downloaded earlier into the Cydia Impactor app.
 
* You will be asked to enter your Apple ID and password. This is used to sign the IPA, so it can run on your device. 

* Cydia Impactor will sign the IPA and install the new Yalu jailbreak app (mach_portal) on your device.
 
* Trust the developer profile created under your email address.
 
* Return to the Home screen and launch the Yalu (mach_portal) app. You'll see a white screen displayed for about 15-20 seconds.

Your device shall reboot and you'll have Cydia on your SpringBoard! 
**Congratulations, you're jailbroken!**
